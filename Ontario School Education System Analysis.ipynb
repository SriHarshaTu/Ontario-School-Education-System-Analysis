    "\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing data from various educational sources in Ontario, Canada, to understand patterns and trends in student achievements, demographics, and transitions to postsecondary education. The analysis integrates multiple datasets provided by the Ontario Government, each offering a unique perspective on different aspects of the education system, including school information, student demographics, academic performance, and transitions to postsecondary institutions. By combining these datasets, we aim to derive actionable insights that could guide educational policies and strategies for improving student outcomes and educational equity across regions."

    "\n",
    "Each team member faced unique challenges while working with their respective datasets:\n",
    "- Rahul's challenge involved handling inconsistent 'NA' values, where some values were written as ' NA'. This required him to address the issue using SQL queries and data preprocessing techniques, such as replacing NaN values with empty strings to ensure smooth insertion of the data into MySQL.\n",
    "- Ayush's challenge focused on optimizing database performance by modifying the data types of columns, particularly converting relevant fields to numeric types (e.g., INT and DECIMAL), which streamlined calculations and aggregations for better efficiency.\n",
    "- For Juan, the challenges included managing missing data by replacing empty strings with NULL values and normalizing numeric columns, particularly ensuring that commas and symbols were removed to properly convert them into appropriate data types for analysis.\n",
    "- Ojas faced some challenges like including the removal of \"Total Entry\" rows, which contained aggregate totals that could lead to double counting and inflated percentages. To address this, he filtered out these rows to focus on individual pathways, ensuring more accurate analysis.\n",
    "- Harsha's main challenge was dealing with null values and special cases, such as \"SP\" (suppressed data) and \"<10\" (indicating small cell counts). To clean the dataset, he replaced these values with None and ensured that numeric fields contained valid numbers or None. His approach helped standardize the data, making it more consistent and ready for analysis."

    "## Feedback Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I would have loved to see the graduation rates for more years rather than the two years you provided. Perhaps this was due to the limitation of the slides, but knowing how the graduation rates compared over the years would have been nice to see. Additionally, will you be looking into other factors when comparing graduation rates for the different boards? For example, it was previously mentioned in the presentation that some regions of Ontario outperformed others. Could this play a factor in why the graduation rate has been on a decline for newer boards compared to older ones? Maybe looking at newer and older boards in each region can give a clearer result to see if, indeed, newer boards are better than older ones.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "Our current dataset includes information only for the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 academic years. While we made considerable efforts to obtain additional years of data to analyze year-over-year trends, time limitations prevented us from securing this extended dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various factors such as the type of education board (e.g., public or private), the language of instruction, and the geographical region which may have an impact on the graduation rate. While the type of board was addressed in specific guiding questions, we opted not to center the analysis solely on graduation rates. Regional differences, which are equally significant, were noted as an area for future exploration. Given the constraints of this project, we focused on a subset of variables rather than incorporating every possible factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation regarding regional variations is valid. In future analyses, it would be valuable to investigate how graduation rates are influenced by regional factors, as well as the differences between newer and older boards. Such an analysis could offer deeper insights into the performance trends across various regions and board types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What were the key findings from your analysis of postsecondary pathways and how did the results vary across different regions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "The key findings from our analysis of postsecondary pathways revealed that higher suspension rates in high school were associated with a decrease in university entry and an increase in college entry. This suggests that suspensions may have a long-term impact on students' decisions regarding postsecondary education.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One question I had is whether you explored regional policies that might explain the disparities in suspension rates across different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "We did not have access to data on regional policies that could explain the disparities in suspension rates across different areas. However, this is an important factor to consider, and we could gather such data in the future to make it a part of our analysis. By incorporating regional policies, we would be able to better understand how different educational systems or disciplinary approaches might influence suspension rates and overall student outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. One question I have is regarding the decision to aggregate data at the regional level for socio-economic analysis. Have you considered whether aggregating might mask intra-regional disparities, such as differences between urban and rural schools within the same region? I’m curious about why you chose these groupings instead of using Ontario’s officially recognized 15 regions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I’m curious about why you chose these groupings instead of using Ontario’s officially recognized 15 regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "These distinctions could provide valuable insights into how socio-economic factors impact student performance more specifically. Unfortunately, we do not have access to data that separates urban and rural regions at this time. However, it’s a great point, and in the future, exploring these granular distinctions could help us offer more targeted analysis and potentially uncover significant variations within regions that could further enrich our findings.\n"

    "#### Rahul\n",
    "Each team member gained valuable insights from this project, building on their unique strengths and learning opportunities. I deepened my understanding of data cleaning and preprocessing, particularly in handling nuanced errors like inconsistent missing values. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of how to write complex SQL join queries and use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to streamline data processing and facilitate more efficient analysis. We all gained a better grasp of teamwork, learning to manage tasks effectively and collaborate under tight deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future extensions, we could broaden the analysis to include additional academic years, socioeconomic factors, and regional policies. This would enable us to uncover long-term trends, understand disparities in educational outcomes, and explore the influence of policy frameworks on suspension rates and academic performance. Such an extension would provide a more holistic perspective and allow us to make data-driven recommendations for policy improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Juan\n",
    "In this project, I contributed by focusing on data cleaning and normalization, ensuring that missing values were handled properly and numeric columns were standardized. I learned the importance of carefully preparing datasets for analysis, as even small inconsistencies can skew results. If I were to do this project again, I would pay more attention to the data visualization aspect, perhaps using more advanced tools like Tableau or Power BI to create clearer and more informative visual representations of trends. Looking ahead, I see potential opportunities in incorporating machine learning models to predict educational outcomes based on demographic factors, which could offer more proactive insights for improving student achievement and targeting interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Harsha\n",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of how to efficiently join multiple datasets and handle real-world data using SQL. Improved my skills in writing complex queries and creating new tables to store derived results. I also learned how to fetch data from databases by executing SQL queries and managing database operations effectively. This experience deepened my understanding of retrieving, filtering, and aggregating data from relational databases. Additionally, I developed skills in interpreting statistical results and drawing conclusions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ojas\n",
    "As part of this project, I was responsible for exploring the Board Region dataset and its integration with other datasets. If I were to repeat this analysis, I would include additional demographic data to better understand how suspension rates impact different student populations. For future work, I would like to incorporate individual-level data. This would provide deeper insights into how suspensions directly affect students' academic pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ayush\n",
    "I am more comfortable working with SQL. I moved beyond theoretical knowledge and applied SQL in real-world scenarios, learning to handle large datasets and complex queries. I gained more hands-on experience, which helped me understand SQL better and use it in database management and data manipulation. In the future, incorporating data visualization tools could significantly improve the presentation of insights, making the findings more accessible and engaging."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of the Ontario education system has provided valuable insights into the relationship between socio-economic factors, gender distribution of educators, suspensions, and postsecondary choices. We observed that, while regions with higher proportions of low-income families or less-educated parents (such as the Toronto Region) demonstrated high academic performance, the North Region experienced lower scores despite fewer such socio-economic challenges. This suggests that factors beyond socio-economic status, such as local educational infrastructure, may play a significant role in student achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our investigation into the influence of gender ratios among educators on EQAO and OSSLT results revealed no significant impact on student performance, challenging the notion that educator gender directly affects academic outcomes. Additionally, we found that higher suspension rates in high school were correlated with a reduction in university entry and an increase in college entry, highlighting the long-term effects of school discipline on postsecondary choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of suspension data, we determined that the Public District School Board accounted for the largest share of total suspensions over the years, while the western region of Ontario contributed most to the year with the highest number of suspensions, which occurred in 2007-2008. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing suspension rates as a means of improving overall student engagement and success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project has highlighted important trends in Ontario’s education system, and the results suggest opportunities for targeted interventions to improve academic outcomes, reduce suspensions, and foster better postsecondary transitions for students across various regions and demographics. Future research could expand on these findings by exploring additional factors affecting academic performance, such as teaching quality, curriculum differences, or regional educational policies."
